# My Min Browser userscripts collection

This is my collection of userscripts for Min Browser, feel free to contribute too. Usually these scripts also work in browsers or extensions that support userscripts, not just in the min browser.

Can you imagine a friend turns on the computer to research a school project and notices that all the images on all the sites are troll faces? It is also possible to easily substitute for any image you are interested in, just by changing the url in the script.
